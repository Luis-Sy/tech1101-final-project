			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<img src="images/luis.jpg" alt="An image of me">
			<p>(I promise I can smile, this is a bad example) </p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>I’m someone who has always had a fascination with computers and digital technology while growing up, which still lives on strong within me in the present. I could spend hours learning how a program worked, or watching the process to create it step by step, breaking it down as it goes. Sometimes I look back at my younger self and wonder whether or not I was just deeply passionate about technology in general or if I was teetering on the edge of obsession, because there were times I’d stay up late in the night being deeply invested in some concept or topic at the cost of sleep.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>In the past and now in the present, I have learned/continue to learn various different skills:</h2>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>html/css/javascript (past experience from high school and currently learning more in college)</li>
				<li>C++ (currently studying)</li>
				<li>C# (experience in the past making basic programs and games)</li>
				<li>Python (similar experience as c#)</li>
				<li>Arduino code</li>
				<br>
				<p>Here are some projects I did the coding for:</p>

				<br><br>
				<p>(Below are skills I have learnt in the past but have long gone rusty from lack of use, I’m willing to pick them back up one day if need be)</p><br>
				<li>SQL</li>
				<li>TSQL</li>
				<li>jQuery</li>
				<li>Ajax</li>
				<li>Node.Js</li>
				<li>React (Node.Js)</li>
				<li>xampp</li>
				<li>MongoDB</li>
				<li>Basic website server hosting on a Raspberry Pi</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Working with others is something I’ve come to find appreciation for in recent years, especially so due to quarantine restrictions forcing everyone to stay cooped up at home. If you asked the younger me from a few years back, he would have said he dread group projects and being forced to work with people he knows little about. Today however, I’m able to find enjoyment in coordinating tasks with others, and learning more about them in the process. Compared to before, I’m a lot less shy when it comes to meeting new people and like hearing the stories they have to share about themselves, it lets me broaden my worldview bit by bit. With this in mind, I can generally work with almost anyone, just as long as their attitude isn’t too disagreeable.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Outside of programming and technology related affairs, I also harbor a deep interest for the arts. I myself am a hobbyist digital artist, the only formal education I have is only rudimentary knowledge from elementary school, the rest I know is self-taught. I still have a long way to go, and am not the most confident in my abilities, so please do not seek me out for art-related reasons for the time being. I attribute my own tendency to find value in places people may not expect to this passion of mine, and believe that it has “opened my eyes” so to speak to the beauty in the world all around us.</p>
			<br>
			<p>At the current moment, I’m working towards hopefully gaining a career in web development, particularly with the front-end side of things, I was always a visual-oriented individual at heart. I have no work experience, but I’m looking towards landing my first internship sometime either this year or in the next.</p>
